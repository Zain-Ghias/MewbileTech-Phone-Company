# **MewbileTech Phone Company üåü**

## **Overview**

This project is a **phone company billing and visualization system**, developed as part of **CSC148 at the University of Toronto**. The goal was to **process customer call data**, apply various **filters**, and generate **monthly billing summaries**, all while visualizing call patterns on a map of **Toronto** using `pygame`.

## **Features**

‚úÖ **Call Data Processing** ‚Äì Reads a dataset of historical calls and organizes customer information.\
‚úÖ **Billing System** ‚Äì Calculates monthly bills based on contract types (**Term, Month-to-Month, Prepaid**).\
‚úÖ **Call Filtering** ‚Äì Supports filtering by **customer, location, duration**, and more.\
‚úÖ **Visualization** ‚Äì Uses `pygame` to display call connections on a real **Toronto map**.\
‚úÖ **Parallel Processing (Optional Task)** ‚Äì Experimented with threading to improve performance.

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Initial View - All Calls Displayed**
This shows the visualization when all calls are displayed with no filters applied.
